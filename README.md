# Summary-of-Java-The-Complete-Reference-Eleventh-Edition
I am trying to get a solid understanding of Java and I came across this awesome book by Herbert Schildt.

In this series of article I am going to summarise what I learned from this book chapter wise. So that when I want to revise the concept I can easily refer to this. If you want to read the java concepts in real quick time, this is for you!

Also, I did some extra research over the internet to make this exercise interesting. I hope you find this helpful.
